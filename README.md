🧮 My Building

A personal project with three goals: learning, continuous improvement, and connecting with people.
Living in an apartment, I noticed that yearly building budget meetings were frustrating. Costs kept rising, yet there were no clear metrics to track building management. This project asks a simple question:

  "How can we improve what we cannot measure?"

By tracking and analyzing building-related data, this application aims to provide actionable insights and help make better decisions.

🚀 Features

- Java-based architecture
- RESTful API with Spring Boot
- Track and analyze building management metrics

🛠️ Built With

- IntelliJ IDEA
- Java
- Spring Boot

🧪 Test
- Postman 

📈 Goal

Have fun
Learn Spring Boot
Make building management transparent, measurable, and improvable through simple, clear metrics.
